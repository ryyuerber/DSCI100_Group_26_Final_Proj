    "\n",
    "We plan to use a multifactor linear regression model as a preliminary prediction tool, using players' gaming experience, whether they subscribe to newsletters, and age to predict the total amount of time a player will play.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the linear regression model is suitable for predicting continuous response variables (such as total play time), and can handle both numerical variables (age) and categorical variables (experience and subscription after factoring and numericalized).\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical presupposition\n",
    "- Assume a linear relationship between each predictor and response variable.\n",
    "- Need to convert character variables to factors or numerical numbers (0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential limitations or weaknesses\n",
    "- If there are nonlinear relationships or significant interactions between the predictor and response variables, a simple linear model may not be sufficient to capture these complex relationships.\n",
    "- The current dataset may not collect all the important factors that affect the game duration, thus reducing the explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "project\n",
    "1. Check and clean the data (dealing with missing values and outliers).\n",
    "2. Convert character variables (such as experience and subscribe) into factors and construct dummy variables if necessary.\n",
    "3. Split the data set into training set and test set. The recommended ratio is 70% training set and 30% test set.\n",
    "4. In the training stage, cross-validation is used to further adjust the model parameters to ensure that the model has good generalization performance on the unseen data.\n",
    "5. Use k-fold cross-validation (5 or 10 fold) to evaluate the model's performance on the training set to prevent overfitting or underfitting."
